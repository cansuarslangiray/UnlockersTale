# Unlocker’s Tale

Unlocker’s Tale is a 3D third-person adventure game inspired by "Open the Door: A Short Story". The game consists of three levels, each with a different playing style, but the objective remains the same: find the key in each level to open the doors and progress to the next level.

## How to Play

### Level 1: House
- The player starts inside a house and must find the key to open the house door.
- Attempting to open the door without the key will prompt the player to find the key first.
- Once the key is acquired, a confirmation panel will appear, allowing the player to open the door and proceed to the next level.
